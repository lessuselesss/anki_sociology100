# Chapter 13: Social Change: Collective BehaviouSocial Movements

## Overview
The chapter is divided into two main sections:
A. Collective Behaviour
B. Social Movements

## A. Collective Behaviour

### Definition
Collective Behaviour is defined as:
- Group behaviour that is relatively spontaneous
- Unstructured
- Unconventional
- Can occur in localized crowds or dispersed forms

### Explaining Crowd Behaviour

1. **Contagion Theory**
   - Views crowd behaviour as irrational
   - Key theorists:
     - LeBon: Emphasizes anonymity, contagion, and suggestibility
     - Blumer: Focuses on milling, collective excitement, and social contagion
   - Example: Vancouver Stanley Cup riots (2011)

2. **Convergence Theory**
   - Views crowd behaviour as rational
   - People with prior predispositions come together
   - Example: Anarchists converging to participate in a riot

3. **Emergent Norm Theory**
   - New norms emerge in unique situations
   - Crowd members create justifications for these new norms
   - Example: Deciding what to do when an instructor suddenly leaves

### Dispersed Forms of Collective Behaviour

1. **Fads**
   - Temporary, highly popular social patterns
   - Can involve activities, hobbies, or collectibles
   - Example: Hula hoop
     - Invented in 1957
     - Sold 100 million units in 1958

2. **Fashions**
   - Longer-lasting popular social patterns
   - Usually involving clothing and accessories

3. **Rumours**
   - Unsubstantiated stories about people or events
   - Characteristics of rumour spread:
     - Information is levelled
     - Information is sharpened
     - Assimilation occurs

4. **Gossip**
   - Can be unsubstantiated or substantiated stories about specific individuals
   - Example: Celebrity gossip

5. **Urban Legends**
   - Abstract stories with an underlying message that persists over time
   - Examples: 
     - Gum containing spider eggs
     - Murderous hitchhikers
     - Flashing headlights after dark

6. **Panic**
   - Can be widespread (e.g., War of the Worlds radio broadcast)
   - Moral panic involves:
     - "Folk devils"
     - Moral entrepreneurs
     - Mass media
     - Disproportionality

7. **Disasters**
   - Can be caused by nature, human inventions, or technological advancement
   - People's behaviour is based on their relationship with environments and community

## B. Social Movements

### Definition
Social Movements are:
- Efforts to change or resist change in major aspects of society
- Organized, planned, and enduring
- Engage in claims making

### Dimensions of Social Change
1. Type of change
2. Degree of change
3. Intended recipient
4. Means utilized

### Explaining Social Movements

1. **Value-Added Theory**
   - Stages:
     - Structural conduciveness (broad social conditions)
     - Structural strain (underlying social problems)
     - Spread of generalized belief (growing awareness)
     - Precipitating factors (triggers or breaking points)
     - Mobilization of participation
     - Operation of social control

2. **Resource Mobilization Theory**
   - Social movements develop based on how resources are utilized by leaders
   - Often combined with political process theory

3. **New Social Movement Theory**
   - Focuses on postindustrial social movements
   - Emphasizes human rights and global issues
   - Collective identity through frame alignment
   - Example: Idle No More movement

### Summary
- Collective behaviour occurs in crowds and dispersed forms
- Social movements:
  - Consist of four dimensions
  - Can take alternative, redemptive, reformative, or revolutionary forms
  - Explained through various theoretical approaches
