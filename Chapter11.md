# Chapter 11: Social Control, Deviance, and Crime

## A. Social Control
- Participants in social control are directed at unacceptable (deviant) acts
- Types of social control:
  - Can be formal or informal
  - Can be retroactive or preventative
  - Can be directed at others or at ourselves

## B. Deviance
### Objective Views of Deviance
Deviance can be defined by:
- Statistical rarity
- Harm
- Negative societal reaction
- Normative violation

### Subjective Views of Deviance
- Deviance is socially constructed
- Something is deviant "if enough important people say so"
- Distinguishes between high-consensus and low-consensus deviance

## C. Crime
### Definitions and Characteristics
- Criminal behavior is a specific form of deviance
- Crime = any behavior that violates criminal law
- Criminal law is part of public law and is codified (e.g., Criminal Code of Canada)

### Views on Law and Crime
1. Consensus Model
   - Society agrees on certain acts that threaten societal survival
   - Broad consensus on some crimes (e.g., pedophilia)

2. Conflict Model
   - Criminal law represents values of the ruling class
   - Criminal justice system as a means of controlling powerless classes

3. Interactionist Model
   - Focus on special interest groups competing for power
   - Interaction between groups with various types of power (financial, racial, religious, political)

### Legal Ingredients of a Crime
- The act must be defined as criminal
- Requires two key elements:
  1. Actus Reus (guilty act)
  2. Mens Rea (guilty mind/intent)

### Types of Offences
- Indictable Offences (more serious)
  - Examples: homicide, sexual assault, fraud
- Summary Offences (minor)
  - Examples: trespassing, causing a disturbance
  - Result in fines or shorter jail terms (24 months or less)

### Crime Statistics
- Measured by Uniform Crime Reporting System (UCR)
- Discrepancy between media perception and reality
  - Media portrays violent crime as out of control
  - Reality: Most crimes are property crimes
  - Crime has declined since 1991

### Diverse Forms of Crime
- White-collar crime
- Corporate crime
- Organized crime
- Cybercrime

### Ethnicity and Crime in Canada
- Aboriginal overrepresentation
  - 3% of population, 17% of federal inmates
  - Also overrepresented as victims
- Black overrepresentation
  - 2% of population, 6% of federal inmates
- Limited systematic data due to lack of police reporting

## D. Theorizing Deviance
### Positivist Theories
1. Functionalist Theories
   - Social structure causes deviance
   - Concepts of anomie and gap between goals and means

2. Learning Theories
   - Deviance is learned through:
     - Social learning (rewards, punishments, modeling)
     - Differential association
     - Neutralization techniques

3. Social Control Theories
   - What restrains people from deviance?
   - Social bonds: attachment, commitment, involvement, belief

## E. Theorizing Perceptions of Deviance
### Interpretive Theories
1. Interactionist Perspective
   - Importance of significant others and self-perception
   - Developing understanding of what is "deviant"

2. Labelling and Stigmatization
   - Primary deviance vs. secondary deviance
   - Impact of being labeled

### Critical Theories
1. Conflict Theories
   - Powerful groups define "normal" and "deviant"

2. Feminist Theories
   - Deviance standards are gendered
   - Gender impacts experiences of social control

3. Postmodern Theories
   - Being monitored leads to self-surveillance
