# Chapter 14: "Going Green" - Environmental Sociology

## A. Factors Posing Environmental Challenges

### 1. Human Overpopulation
- Concept of "ecological overshoot"
  - Humanity's ecological footprint requires 1.5 planets
- Influenced by:
  - Fertility
  - Mortality
  - Migration
- Historical context: Thomas Malthus (1766-1834)
  - Argued for population checks to prevent exceeding human carrying capacity

### 2. Industrialization
- Detailed information not extensively elaborated in the text

### 3. Urbanization
- Key Statistics:
  - 83% of Canada's population lives in urban centres
  - Population concentration:
    * Montreal
    * BC's lower mainland
    * Edmonton/Calgary corridor
    * Golden Horseshoe in Ontario

#### Impacts of Urbanization
- Environmental Consequences:
  - Replacing biodiverse habitats
  - High resource and energy consumption
  - Greenhouse gas and waste production
  - Pollution affecting health
  - Artificial environment changing weather and climate
  - Decreasing biodiversity

### 4. Overconsumption of Resources
- Canada creates 34 million tonnes of solid waste annually
- Average waste per person: 2.2 kilograms per day

#### Greenwashing
- Marketing tactic claiming products are "environmentally friendly"
- In 2010, 95% of "green" products committed one of seven sins of greenwashing

The Seven Sins of Greenwashing:
1. Hidden tradeoff
2. No proof
3. Vagueness
4. Irrelevance
5. Lesser of two evils
6. Fibbing
7. Worshipping false labels

## B. Growing Awareness of Environmental Issues

### Waves of Environmentalism
1. First Wave (1960s and 1970s)
   - Highlighted pollution
   - Focused on environmental disasters
   - Addressed resource depletion

2. Second Wave (1980s onward)
   - Addressed larger environmental issues
   - Focused on ozone layer
   - Concentrated on global warming

### Paradigms of Environmental Thinking

#### 1. Human Exemptionalism Paradigm (HEP)
- Views nature as separate from human society
- Assumes human superiority
- Believes technology will solve environmental problems

#### 2. New Ecological Paradigm (NEP)
- Emphasizes interdependence between human society and nature
- Recognizes unintended consequences of human actions
- Acknowledges limited natural resources

#### 3. Ecological Modernization
- Functionalist perspective
- Believes people, environment, and industry can coexist
- Focuses on:
  - Alternative fuel sources
  - Energy efficiency regulations
  - Energy reforms

### Treadmill of Production
- Focuses on increasing production and profit
- Key Pillars:
  - Economic expansion
  - Increased consumption
  - Problem-solving through accelerated production
  - Alliances among capital, labor, and governments

## D. Strategies for Better Environmental Choices

### 1. Living Green
- Individual behavioral changes
- Personal daily life modifications

### 2. Sustainable Development
- Organizational and group practice changes
- Balancing:
  - Economic objectives
  - Social concerns
  - Environmental concerns

## Summary
- Environmental problems stem from:
  - Overpopulation
  - Industrialization
  - Urbanization
  - Overconsumption
- Environmentalism has evolved through different waves
- Improving environmental conditions requires action from individuals, groups, and organizations
